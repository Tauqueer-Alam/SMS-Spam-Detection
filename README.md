# SMS-Spam-Detection
A web-based application that classifies SMS messages as "Spam" or "Ham" using Natural Language Processing and a trained Machine Learning model. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask, the system uses TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier. The project includes a clean web interface for user input and real-time prediction.
